We caught a Redline variant executing on an endpoint and intercepted the encrypted files as they traversed the edge proxy. Well, everything except for the flag.txt file (imagine that...). Any chance you could figure out how this thing works and recover the flag?

## Solution
In this task, we were given a folder of encrypted files, and another one with the cleartext ones. In addition to this, we got the program that encrypted the files. The only file that was missing from the the cleartext folder was the flag (obviously).

My first thought was to analyze the differences between the encrypted and cleartext files, where I immediately saw that the difference was the same between each file. This meant that I could extract the pattern and apply it to flag.txt.
