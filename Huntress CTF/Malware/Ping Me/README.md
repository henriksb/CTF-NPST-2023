# Ping Me
We found this file in the autoruns of a host that seemed to have a lot of network activity... can you figure out what it was doing?

## Solution
In this task, we got an obfuscated vb-script. To deobfuscate it, I simply changed the first line of the script from `Execute` to `WScript.Echo`. Then, I ran it using cscript.exe and got the content:

```vbs
Dim sh, ips, i
Set sh = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
ips = Array("102.108.97.103", "123.54.100.49", "98.54.48.52", "98.98.49.98", "54.100.97.51", "50.98.56.98", "98.99.97.57", "101.50.54.100", "53.49.53.56", "57.125.35.35")

For i = 0 To UBound(ips)
    ' Using /K instead of /Q /c to keep the console open and show the result
    sh.Run "cmd /Q ping " & ips(i)
Next
```

It took a while before I realised that the IP-adresses were actually ASCII numbers. To get the flag, simply turn each number into its corresponding ASCII character.
