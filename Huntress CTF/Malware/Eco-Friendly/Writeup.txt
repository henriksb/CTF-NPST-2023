File contains "iex" which is Invoke Expression command on powershell. 
It appears that the entire thing is obfuscated, so the way we proceeded was to rename the file to a txt for easier oversight (We also removed the "iex(" and the last ")" then set it to a variable named $command:
PS G:\Nedlastinger> $command = Get-Content -Path "G:\Nedlastinger\encoded_ps1.txt"
PS G:\Nedlastinger> $result = Invoke-Expression($Command)
By running Get-Variable, we could see that the result was actually different this time AND that it included an iex command even though we removed ours at first stage, this points to that there is iex inside an iex and potentially more.
So we simply just put it to a file, and did the same stages again:
PS G:\Nedlastinger> $result | Out-File -FilePath G:\Nedlastinger\decoded-ps1-part1.txt
...
After 3 times, we get the flag inside $result:
result                          # flag{8ba43de1e095287dbbf7722e51239a63}
