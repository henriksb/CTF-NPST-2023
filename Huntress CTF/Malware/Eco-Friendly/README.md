# Eco-Friendly

## Challenge
PowerShell script with nested `iex` (Invoke-Expression) obfuscation.

## Solution
1. Found initial `iex` command in the file
2. Removed outer `iex(...)` and loaded into variable:
```powershell
$command = Get-Content -Path "encoded_ps1.txt"
$result = Invoke-Expression($Command)
```

3. Discovered nested `iex` commands using `Get-Variable`
4. Repeated process 3 times:
```powershell
$result | Out-File -FilePath decoded-ps1-part1.txt
```

5. Flag appeared in `$result` after third deobfuscation

## Flag
```
flag{8ba43de1e095287dbbf7722e51239a63}
```

## Tools
- PowerShell / Terminal
