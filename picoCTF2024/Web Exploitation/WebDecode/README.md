# WebDecode
Do you know how to use the web inspector?
Start searching [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:60527/) to find the flag

## Solution
Free challenge. To get the flag, simply visit `/about` and inspect the elements. Here you will find the following HTML code:

```html
<section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMTBmOTM3NmZ9">
  ```
  
Decode base64 to get the flag.
