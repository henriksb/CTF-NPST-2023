Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Solution

When opening the website, a registration form is shown. To solve the challenge, we fill in the first form and continue to the 2FA-authentication page. Since we do not have the OTP code, we have to exploit the website to allow us to proceed.

When entering OTP code, make a malformed input in burpsuite:

```
b
b
b
b
bbbb
bb
otp=%22
```
