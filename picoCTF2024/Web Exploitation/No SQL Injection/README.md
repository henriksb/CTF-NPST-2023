# No Sql Injection
You can download the source [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_atlas/29/app.tar.gz).
The website is running [here](http://atlas.picoctf.net:61553/). Can you log in?

## Solution 

When entering the website, we land on a login page. The hint is in the title of the task, we have to exploit a NoSQL injection. To do this we can use the following input as both a username and password: `{"$nin": []}`.

As specified by [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/nin/), the value `$nin` selects the documents wehre the specified field value is not in the specified array or the field does not exist. This means that the input will always be equal to true, causing us to login without any credentials.

I opened in the website in burpsuite and got the response:
`[{"_id":"65f08d5715535af6a1394524","email":"joshiriya355@mumbama.com","firstName":"Josh","lastName":"Iriya","password":"Je80T8M7sUA","token":"cGljb0NURntqQmhEMnk3WG9OelB2XzFZeFM5RXc1cUwwdUk2cGFzcWxfaW5qZWN0aW9uX2UzMWVmMzI0fQ==","__v":0}]`

The flag is in base64.
