# Unminify
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:53048/), and find the flag!

## Solution
This is a free challenge. To solve it, simply inspect the elements and the flag will be found:

```html
<p class="picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_ed938a7e}"></p>
```
