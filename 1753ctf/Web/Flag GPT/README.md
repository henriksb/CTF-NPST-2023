# ðŸ’¬ Flag GPT (Score: 100 / Solves: 55)
Chat GPT was too easy to fool, still giving our flag to unauthorized players.
Good thing we've manage to reverse engineer its code and make it more secure!

## Solution

In this task, we were tasked with exploiting an online chatbot. The important part of the code is the following:
 ```js   
if (req.socket.remoteAddress != '127.0.0.1') //make sure flag is just for locally
    do {
        req.query.message = req.query.message.replace(/(flag)/i, "");
    } while (req.query.message.indexOf("flag") > -1)
```

Initially, I though we were going to fake our IP to be localhost. I changed all the possible HTTP headers with no luck. Then I took a look at the code again and noticed the vulnerability.
        
This loop is designed to remove occurrences of the word "flag" from the input, irrespective of case. It does this by repeatedly checking for "flag" in a case-insensitive manner and removing any matches it finds. However, the loop continues to run as long as "flag" is found in the text using a case-sensitive search. This leads to a specific behavior: if the input is "flag flag" or "Flag flag", all instances are removed because the loop's case-insensitive removal process catches them all. But, if you enter "flag FlaG", the outcome is different. The first "flag" (in lowercase) gets removed during the first loop iteration. The loop then looks for "flag" in a case-sensitive manner and doesn't recognize "FlaG" due to the case difference. As a result, "FlaG" remains in the input. Since subsequent checks for "flag" are case-insensitive, they detect "FlaG", and the system responds with the flag. This discrepancy between the case-insensitive removal of "flag" and the case-sensitive continuation condition allows for specific case variations of "flag" to bypass the filter.
